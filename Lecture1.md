# Introduction to Functional Programming (In Haskell)

## Purity
- All functions are pure with explicitly managed side effects
- Functions are first class
    - Functions can be passed around as values

## Lazy Evaluation
- In Haskell, expressions are not evaluated until their results are actually needed.
- Helps to enable structure through composition

## Statically Typed
- `Yeet`
- Love ADT's

## Abstraction
Haskell is very good at abstraction:
- Parametric polymorphism
- Higher-order functions
- Type classes
all aid in the fight against repetition.

## Wholemeal programming - YUM
- Work in a higher level of expressiveness
- Don't worry about the largely irrelevant details of how basic things like iteration work internally
- Think about the problem domain and not the implementation cruft
